# StreetFucker
StreetFucker is a little multiplayer street fighting game for the Minecraft mod OpenComputer.

This is my very first video game ever made, a long while ago.
The source code is... creepy. So better dont even look at it ':)

I hope u like it and have some fun with it :)

# Third Party
With the v1.0 release it utilizes the [DoubleBuffering library](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/DoubleBuffering) by IgorTimofeev to avoid graphical flickering.
