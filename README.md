# StreetFucker
StreetFucker is a little multiplayer street fighting game for the Minecraft mod OpenComputer.

This is my very first video game ever made, a long while ago.
The source code is... creepy. So better dont even look at it ':)

I hope u like it and have some fun with it :)

# Installing
If you have an internet card installed you can simply run this command line to install the game into the current dir:
```
pastebin get Jurnjfjq .streenfucker_installer.lua; .streenfucker_installer.lua StreetFucker; rm .streenfucker_installer.lua
```

# Third Party
With the v1.0 release it utilizes the [DoubleBuffering library](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/DoubleBuffering) by IgorTimofeev to avoid graphical flickering.
